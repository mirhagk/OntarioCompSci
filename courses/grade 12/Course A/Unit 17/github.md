How to get your github private repositories
===================
----------------

Github provides free private repositories to any student, which is great news.

Step 1
-----------

Create a github account, if you already have one then you're awesome and can skip to step 2.

Go to [Github](https://github.com/) and create your profile. Enter a desired username, and password and your email address. This should be your main email address.

After you're finished creating your profile go to step 2.

Step 2
------------

Go to your [profile settings](https://github.com/settings/emails), and add your school email to your account. This will help Github to know that you are in fact a student. Make sure you verify this email address as well.

Once it's verified you can get your free upgrade

Step 3
---------------

Go to [https://github.com/edu]() to request your student account. Enter any information it asks for, and select your school email address.

Once this step is done, a Github representative will review it and grant you your free upgrade.

Now when you create a new repository you can select to have a private repository if you don't feel comfortable sharing your repository publicly.
