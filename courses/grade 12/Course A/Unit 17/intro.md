Unit 17 - Version Control
=======================

Intro
-----

What is Version Control? Version Control is a way to keep track of old versions of code. Have you ever written code like:

	//x = x * y / 3;
	//x = x * y * 2;
	x = x * y;

Where you have several lines of commented code that you don't want to delete just in case you have to go back to the old version?

This is the kind of problem source control fixes. Basically with source control you can `commit` new versions of the code, and it'll keep track of all your old versions. If you realize you made a mistake and need to go back, you can do that without filling your code with useless lines like above.

Source Control can also be used to work together on a group project without running into issues when you both work on a file at the same time.
