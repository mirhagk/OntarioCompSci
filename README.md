OntarioCompSci
==============

Curriculum documents and example courses. Future goal is to have complete courses that cover the curriculum that computer science teachers can grab and use.


Purpose
----------------

The purpose of this project is to allow collaboration on the design of several example computer science courses. The goal is to give schools that don't have a strong computer science department the ability to select a course with lots of supplementary material, and offer a good computer science course to students.



Goals
-------------------

+ Give example courses for teachers to adapt to their own school
+ Standardize computer science education in Ontario
+ Provide course material in several major, modern languages
+ Give universities the ability to assume how much first year's should know
	+ Ultimately it's a goal that there should be a first optional year to introduce all the concepts high school taught, and a 2nd year that students may skip into if they took proper Comp Sci in high school
