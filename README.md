OntarioCompSci
==============

Curriculum documents and example courses. Future goal is to have complete courses that cover the curriculum that computer science teachers can grab and use.


Purpose
----------------

The purpose of this project is to allow collaboration on the design of several example computer science courses. The goal is to give schools that don't have a strong computer science department the ability to select a course with lots of supplementary material, and offer a good computer science course to students.



Goals
-------------------

+ Give example courses for teachers to adapt to their own school
+ Standardize computer science education in Ontario
+ Provide course material in several major, modern languages
+ Give universities the ability to assume how much first year's should know
	+ Ultimately it's a goal that there should be a first optional year to introduce all the concepts high school taught, and a 2nd year that students may skip into if they took proper Comp Sci in high school

Read goals.md for a description of the goals for each example course

How to use this repository
----------------------------

Within the courses directory there are 2 sections, grade 11 and grade 12. Within those is a list of course folders, labelled alphabetically.

Course A in grade 11 and Course A in grade 12 should follow the same general idea, and be designed to be a natural choice to use together. However this does not prevent you from selecting different courses for each grade

Academic Honesty Policy
------------------------

We take academic honesty very seriously. Anything within this repository can be assumed to be given to any student, so nothing can be placed in here that would encourage academic dishonesty. As such this repository must not contain any answers sheets or example solutions that would not already be given to students.

Answer sheets can still be created, however a separate private repository must be created for those, and anyone who requests access must be verified as a teacher before they are given access to any part of it.

While students are encouraged to share their projects online with others, and to take those projects and expand upon them, students must not take credit for any other student's work. Project comparison tools will be recommended to teachers to make sure they only count the parts the student has changed, and the student should describe what they have done (ideally by using source control, and the teacher looking through the commit history)

Confidentiality
-------------

While students are encouraged to share their projects with the world, they should never be required to, and the school needs to provide a way for these students to use private repositories for their source control.
Ways this can be enabled are listed below:

+ School host source control servers for students that would like to keep their project confidential
+ Schools pay for github's (or similar) private repositories for these students.
+ Students can used distributed source control systems, and not have a central server
